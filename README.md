# BLEM: A dynamic module!
## setup
1. download the required packages (poetry.sh in the install directory for poetry install)
2. go to install.py in the install directory
3. download blem.py from the install directory
4. add the blem.py to the same directory as the file that will import it
5. add the contents from blem.txt to the top of the importing file
## dynamic advantages
1. automatic updates
2. extremely low size on disk (just from the import and the small file
## dynamic disadventages
1. slow start (needs to fetch the functions)
## extra
1. check the cmd directory for the functions (add blem. to the start and replace the .py with a .x)
2. there is an extra function built into the package.py file used in the dynamic module code itself
3. some functions have every line of code accompanied by a comment explaining every step (go to the cmd directory)
