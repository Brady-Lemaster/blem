# BLEM: A dynamic module!
## setup
1. download the required packages (i think openai and matplotlib)
2. go to install.py in the install directory
3. download blem.py from the install directory
4. add the blem.py to the same directory as the file that will import it
5. add the contents from blem.txt to the top of the importing file
## stuff
check the cmd folder for the functions (add blem. to the start and replace the .py with a .x)
there is an extra cmd built into the package file used in the dynamic module code itself
some functions have every line of code accompanied by a comment explaining every step
